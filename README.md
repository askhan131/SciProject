Bike sharing became a transport mobility trend in recent years as it is easily accessible and effordable to everyone. However, it is very difficult to deal with unpredictable user demand due to the asymmetric spatio and temporal factors that can turn the systems into unbalanced situtation. It is very much important to predict the short-run bike sharing demand to improve the efficiency of bike sharing systems. This sector having the consistence growth rate in every year and to keep that pace optimizing deep learning method can be the best way compare to any statistical methods. This paper applies the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting the urban traffic passenger flows of Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. The data sets includes historical bikesharing trip data, historical weathe and holidays data. The spatial and temporal attention mechanism is focused to boost the ability of learning temporal information in LSTM model. The outcomes from the proposed model indicates that the predicted value is giving pretty much accurate value. All the used datast and other files can be found on the given GitHub repositories.
